madlib = f"Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of {state}\n\
There lived a young boy named {boy_name} {animal}\n\
And one day his woman ran off with another guy\n\
Hit young {boy_name} in the {body_part_1}, didn't like that\n\
He said I'm gonna get that boy\n\
So one day he walked into town\n\
Booked himself a room in the local saloon\n\n\
{boy_name} {animal} checked into his room\n\
Only to find Gideon's Bible\n\
{boy_name} had come equipped with a gun\n\
To shoot off the {body_part_2} of his rival\n\
His rival it seems had broken his {plural_noun}\n\
By stealing the girl of his fancy\n\
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil\n\
But everyone knew her as {feminin_name}\n\n\
Now she and her man who called himself Dan\n\
Were in the next room at the {event}\n\
{boy_name} burst in and grinning a grin\n\
He said Danny boy this is a showdown\n\
But Daniel was hot - he drew first and {verb_past}\n\
And {boy_name} collapsed in the corner\n\n\
Now the doctor came in stinking of {beverage}\n\
And proceeded to {verb} on the {furniture}\n\
He said {boy_name} you met your match\n\
And {boy_name} said, doc it's only a scratch\n\
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able\n\n\
Now {boy_name} {animal} he fell back in his room\n\
Only to find Gideon's Bible\n\
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt\n\
To help with good {boy_name}'s revival"
